Given an undirected, connected and weighted graph G(V, E) with V number of vertices (which are numbered from 0 to V-1) and E number of edges.
Find and print the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm.
For printing MST follow the steps -
1. In one line, print an edge which is part of MST in the format - 
v1 v2 w
where, v1 and v2 are the vertices of the edge which is included in MST and whose weight is w. And v1  <= v2 i.e. print the smaller vertex first while printing an edge.
2. Print V-1 edges in above format in different lines.
Note : Order of different edges doesn't matter.
Input Format :
Line 1: Two Integers V and E (separated by space)
Next E lines : Three integers ei, ej and wi, denoting that there exists an edge between vertex ei and vertex ej with weight wi (separated by space)
Output Format :
Print the MST, as described in the task.
Constraints :
2 <= V, E <= 10^5
1 <= Wi <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
