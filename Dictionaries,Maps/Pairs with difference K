You are given with an array of integers and an integer K. You have to find and print the count of all such pairs which have difference K.
Note: Take absolute difference between the elements of the array.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of the size of the array. Let us denote it with the symbol n.
The following line contains n space separated integers, that denote the value of the elements of the array.
The following line contains an integer, that denotes the value of K.
Output format :
The first and only line of output contains count of all such pairs which have an absolute difference of K. 
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10^4
Time Limit: 1 sec

program:
def printPairDiffK(l, k):
    pairCount=0
    m={}
    for num in l:
        if num+k in m:
            pairCount+=m[num+k]
        if k!=0 and num-k in m:
            pairCount+=m[num-k]
            
        if num in m:
            m[num]+=1
        else:
            m[num]=1
    return pairCount



n=int(input())
l=list(int(i) for i in input().strip().split(' '))
k=int(input())
print(printPairDiffK(l, k))
