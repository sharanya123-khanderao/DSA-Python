You have been given a head to a singly linked list of integers. Write a function check to whether the list given is a 'Palindrome' or not.
 Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First and the only line of each test case or query contains the the elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space.
 Remember/Consider :
While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.
 Output format :
For each test case, the only line of output that print 'true' if the list is Palindrome or 'false' otherwise.
 Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= M <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1sec

Where 'M' is the size of the singly linked list.
Sample Input 1 :
1
9 2 3 3 2 9 -1
Sample Output 1 :
true
Sample Input 2 :
2
0 2 3 2 5 -1
-1
Sample Output 2 :
false
true
Explanation for the Sample Input 2 :
For the first query, it is pretty intuitive that the the given list is not a palindrome, hence the output is 'false'.

For the second query, the list is empty. An empty list is always a palindrome , hence the output is 'true'.

program:
from sys import stdin

class Node :
    def __init__(self, data) :
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
def appendLastNToFirst(head, n) :
    if n == 0 or head is None :
        return head

    fast = head
    slow = head
    initialHead = head

    for i in range(n) :
        fast = fast.next

    while fast.next is not None :
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next

    temp = slow.next
    slow.next = None
    fast.next = initialHead
    head = temp

    return head
def takeInput() :
    head = None
    tail = None

    datas = list(map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split(" ")))

    i = 0
    while (i < len(datas)) and (datas[i] != -1) :
        data = datas[i]
        newNode = Node(data)

        if head is None :
            head = newNode
            tail = newNode

        else :
            tail.next = newNode
            tail = newNode

        i += 1

    return head



def printLinkedList(head) :

    while head is not None :
        print(head.data, end = " ")
        head = head.next

    print()


#main
t = int(stdin.readline().rstrip())

while t > 0 :
    
    head = takeInput()
    n = int(stdin.readline().rstrip())

    head = appendLastNToFirst(head, n)
    printLinkedList(head)

    t -= 1
