Given a string (lets say of length n), print all the subsequences of the given string.
Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n. But the order of characters should remain same as in the input string.
Note :
The order of subsequences are not important. Print every subsequence in new line.
Input format
The input only consists of one line which consists of a single string
Output format
The output consists of all subsequences of the input string where each subsequence is printed in a different line. The order of the subsequences doesn't matter
Constraints
1 <= |S| <= 15
where |S| represents the length of the input string

Time limit: 1 sec
Sample Input:
abc
Sample Output:
"" (the double quotes just signifies an empty string, don't worry about the quotes)
c 
b 
bc 
a 
ac 
ab 
abc 

program:
## Read input as specified in the question.
## Print output as specified in the question.
def printSubsequences(string, si, output):
    if si == len(string):
        print(output)
        return
    printSubsequences(string, si+1, output)

    newOutput = output + string[si]
    printSubsequences(string, si+1, newOutput)
string = input()
printSubsequences(string, 0, "")
