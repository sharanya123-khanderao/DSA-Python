Given a string (let's say of length n), return all the subsequences of the given string.
Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to n. But the order of characters should remain the same as in the input string.
Note: The order of subsequences are not important.
Sample Input:
abc
Sample Output:
"" (the double quotes just signifies an empty string, don't worry about the quotes)
c 
b 
bc 
a 
ac 
ab 
abc 

program:
def subs(s):
    if len(s)==0:
        output=[]
        output.append(" ")
        return output
    
    smallerString = s[1:]
    smallerOutput = subs(smallerString)
    
    output =[]
    for sub in smallerOutput:
        output.append(sub)
    for sub in smallerOutput:
        subs_with_zeroth_char=s[0]+sub
        output.append(subs_with_zeroth_char)
        
    return output

   
    
    pass


string = input()
ans = subs(string)
for ele in ans:
    print(ele)
